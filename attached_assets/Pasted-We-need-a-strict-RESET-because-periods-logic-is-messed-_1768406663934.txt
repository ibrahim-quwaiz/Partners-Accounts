We need a strict RESET because periods logic is messed up.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- Do NOT add new features.
- Do NOT redesign UI.
- Do NOT touch Transactions calculations.
- Only fix periods data + period selector wiring.
- No "all periods" anywhere.
- Keep changes minimal and explicit.

========================
GOAL
========================
1) Remove all existing periods and keep ONLY ONE period per project named:
   "الفترة الافتتاحية"
   status = "Open"
2) Ensure the Period selector in ALL pages is driven ONLY by the periods list of the active project,
   coming from the same source (AppContext / API) and created/managed in the Periods page.
3) If a project has no periods, automatically create the "الفترة الافتتاحية" for that project.

========================
DATABASE ACTION (choose ONE approach)
========================
Preferred: Soft reset (safe)
- Do NOT delete periods.
- Instead set all existing periods for each project to status = "Closed"
- Then create ONE new "الفترة الافتتاحية" with status "Open" per project.

Alternative (only if user approves): Hard delete
- Delete all rows from periods and recreate initial rows.

Implement the PREFERRED soft reset automatically. Do NOT ask the user.

Rules for the created افتتاحية period:
- project_id = activeProjectId
- period_name = "الفترة الافتتاحية"
- start_date = today (auto)
- end_date = null
- status = "Open"
- p1_balance_start = 0
- p2_balance_start = 0
- p1_balance_end = 0
- p2_balance_end = 0

Also enforce: ONLY ONE Open period per project.

========================
PERIODS PAGE BEHAVIOR
========================
- Show periods filtered by project_id
- Remove any row selection checkbox (not needed)
- The page should expose a single action button:
  "تهيئة الفترة الافتتاحية"
  It will run the reset for THIS active project only:
    - Close all old periods for this project
    - Create the افتتاحية Open period if not exists

========================
GLOBAL PERIOD SELECTOR WIRING
========================
- The period dropdown must use ONLY:
  activeProjectId + periods loaded from API/context
- activePeriodId must always be a valid period_id from the filtered list.
- If periods list becomes empty (after reset or on first run),
  automatically create the افتتاحية period and select it.

No Mock data anywhere.

========================
DELIVERABLES
========================
1) List EXACT files you will change (paths only).
2) Provide exact diffs for these files only.
3) Provide the SQL used (if any) or the API calls used to perform the reset.
4) Provide a manual test checklist:
   - select project A -> reset -> only "الفترة الافتتاحية" appears
   - switch to project B -> reset -> only "الفترة الافتتاحية" appears
   - Transactions page loads and shows data for selected period without errors
