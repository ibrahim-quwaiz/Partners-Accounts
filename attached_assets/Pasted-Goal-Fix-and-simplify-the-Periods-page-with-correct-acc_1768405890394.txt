Goal: Fix and simplify the Periods page with correct accounting flow.
Project has multiple projects, and each period must be strictly tied to ONE project_id.
We want minimal changes, no redesign, no new features beyond what is listed.

Scope: ONLY Periods page + its API calls (if needed).
Do NOT refactor other pages.
Do NOT change DB schema (periods table already has project_id and balance columns).

========================
Requirements
========================

A) List / display periods
1) Periods list MUST be filtered by activeProjectId (project_id).
2) Order by newest first.
3) Show columns: period_name (or "فترة #ID"), start_date, end_date, status.
4) Remove any row selection checkbox/button (not needed).

B) Create / open a new period (for the active project)
When user clicks "فتح فترة جديدة":
1) Create a new period row with:
   - project_id = activeProjectId
   - status = "Open"
   - start_date = today (set automatically)
   - end_date = null
2) Opening balances MUST be copied from the last CLOSED period of the SAME project:
   - p1_balance_start = lastClosed.p1_balance_end
   - p2_balance_start = lastClosed.p2_balance_end
3) If no closed period exists for this project, opening balances = 0,0.
4) Ensure only ONE open period is allowed per project:
   - If there is already an Open period for the project, show a message and do not create a new one.

C) Close period
When user clicks "إغلاق الفترة" for an Open period:
1) Call the existing server endpoint (close period) that calculates p1_balance_end/p2_balance_end and validates balance.
2) On success, update UI immediately (status becomes Closed, end_date becomes today if server returns it).
3) On failure, show the error message returned by server (e.g., unbalanced).

D) UI behavior constraints
1) Do not ask the user to manually enter start_date or end_date.
2) Keep the page simple: one table + "فتح فترة جديدة" + "إغلاق الفترة" buttons.
3) Do not add "all periods" option anywhere on this page.

========================
Deliverables
========================
1) Tell me exactly which files you will edit (paths).
2) Provide exact code changes only (diff or full updated file).
3) Provide a quick manual test checklist:
   - create first period for a project
   - close it
   - create next period and verify opening balances copied from previous end balances
