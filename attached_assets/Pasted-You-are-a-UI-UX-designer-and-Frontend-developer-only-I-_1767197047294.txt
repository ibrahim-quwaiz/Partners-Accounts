You are a UI/UX designer and Frontend developer only.
I have a simple accounting application for two partners (P1 and P2).
The backend (Supabase + CRUD logic) already exists and works well.
I want to redesign ONLY the frontend UI, replacing Streamlit with a modern web interface.
Do NOT change backend logic or database structure.

Important context:
- The same user manages TWO projects.
- Both projects must live inside the SAME application.
- Best approach: ONE database with data isolated by project_id (multi-project / multi-tenant).
- The UI must allow switching between projects, and all data must be filtered by the selected project.

Current tables in Supabase:
- expenses
- revenues
- settlements
- periods
- partners

Goal:
A clean, stable, production-oriented internal accounting UI.
No over-engineering. Step by step.

Tech preferences (frontend only):
- React or Next.js
- TypeScript preferred (JavaScript acceptable)
- Tailwind CSS
- Simple component-based design
- RTL-friendly layout (Arabic-ready)

Main layout:
- Top bar with:
  - App name
  - Project selector (dropdown)
  - Period selector (dropdown)
- Sidebar or tabs for navigation:
  - Transactions
  - Reports
  - Notifications (placeholder)

Main page: Transactions
- Tabs:
  - Expenses
  - Revenues
  - Settlements

For each tab:
- Table displaying records
- Clear columns (date, description, amount, partner info)
- Actions per row:
  - Edit
  - Delete
- Delete must NEVER be direct:
  - Show confirmation dialog/modal:
    “Are you sure you want to delete this record?”
    Buttons: Cancel / Confirm Delete

Forms:
- Add and Edit must open in modal dialogs
- Simple, clear labels
- No advanced validation yet

Expenses & Revenues:
- Fields:
  - Date
  - Description
  - Amount
  - Paid by (P1 / P2)

Settlements:
- Fields:
  - Date
  - Description
  - Amount
  - From partner (P1 / P2)
  - To partner (auto-calculated)

UX requirements:
- Clear success and error messages
- Loading states when fetching data
- Minimal, clean dashboard look
- Focus on usability, not fancy visuals

Multi-project support:
- Project selector at the top
- All lists, forms, and actions must work within the selected project context (project_id)
- Same workflow reused for both projects

Deliverables:
- Frontend project structure (pages, components, modals)
- Reusable components:
  - ProjectSelector
  - PeriodSelector
  - DataTable
  - ConfirmDeleteDialog
- A working UI (can use mock data if API integration is not required yet)
- Basic styling with Tailwind
- Instructions to run the frontend locally

Constraints:
- No authentication for now
- No notifications logic yet
- No performance optimizations
- No backend changes

Priority:
1) Transactions page
2) Confirm delete flow
3) Project selector
4) Clean, stable UI
